# license-to-plate
Simple voting webpage that pairs images against eachother and keeps track of the winners

## Yearly Plate Setup

### Step 1
Download plate zone server images via "discrub" browser extension, separating by author. Rename the plates at this stage

### Step 2
Rename the plate image files to "platex.jpg", where x is the plate ID

### Step 3
Copy all plate images into one directory, while still maintaining the separate list of plates by author (this will come in handy when announcing winners)

### Step 4
Resize all images to same aspect ratio using "resize.py" script. Make sure to set the input and output directories and run 'pip install pillow' before running the script

### Step 5
TBD
